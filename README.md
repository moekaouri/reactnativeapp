react native test app
This  React Native application will have 2 pages, that the user can switch between them using a top menu.

There should be a search input

I will be using Youtube api to get the data

The result should be rendered in a list

When the user clicks on any item of the list, he should see more details on the right about the selected item.

IN THE SECOND PAGE:
There should be 2 buttons + and -, that can change the value of the number in the middle, by either adding or removing 1
this page is made using redux to make sure thate the connection between actions and reducers in redux is wotking 


the application will be responsive with error handling for https requests failure with an added loader while waiting for the data to be fetched nad unit tests.


i will be adding extra simple auth user sign in and sign up using firebase with error handling
